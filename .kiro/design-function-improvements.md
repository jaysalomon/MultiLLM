# MultiLLM Design & Function Improvements

## Purpose
Document the prioritized UX and feature improvements identified for the MultiLLM application so design and engineering can plan focused follow-up sprints.

## UI & Visual Enhancements
- **Multi-lane conversation view**: Present each participant in its own lane or card with chronological markers to clarify cross-LLM dialogue.
- **Participant control sidebar**: Move model, endpoint, and budget controls into a collapsible sidebar with provider-specific avatars or color accents.
- **Live turn indicator**: Surface an always-visible indicator showing the active LLM and queue order, using subtle motion to telegraph speaking turns.
- **Expanded theme system**: Add light, high-contrast, and textured theme variants with a quick toggle in the header.
- **Richer composer**: Introduce inline formatting, token and cost previews, and shortcuts for inserting files/snippets into the prompt.
- **Diagnostics drawer**: Provide a bottom drawer for optional logs, API payloads, latency, and cost metrics to aid debugging without cluttering the main view.

## Functional Enhancements
- **Conversation templates**: Allow users to define reusable orchestration patterns (debate, critique, planning) that preconfigure roles, prompts, and turn counts.
- **Adaptive turn management**: Expose controls for number of rounds, stopping criteria, and manual handoff between participants mid-conversation.
- **Context capsules**: Let users pin key data (snippets, uploaded docs, highlights) that the orchestrator injects into every subsequent LLM turn.
- **Automated outcome summaries**: Designate a “closer” or analyst model to generate final summaries, decision matrices, or action lists after the conversation.
- **Cost & performance analytics**: Visualize session-level token usage, latency per provider, and cumulative spend using existing performance/cost services.
- **History curation tools**: Support inline editing or redaction of specific messages before propagating them to the next participant to refine context.
- **Plugin hook system**: Offer a lightweight API slot for custom pre/post-processing (e.g., fact-checking, tone adjustment) without changing the core app.
- **Persistent sessions**: Store conversations, participant configurations, and custom endpoints so sessions can be resumed, cloned, tagged, and searched.

## Suggested First Sprint
1. Ship the participant sidebar + live turn indicator to validate the refreshed layout.
2. Implement persistent sessions leveraging the existing database layer.
3. Prototype a diagnostics drawer wired to current logging and cost services.

## Follow-Up Considerations
- Align with design on updated component library/styles before broad UI refactors.
- Schedule user testing to confirm the new conversation layout improves comprehension.
- Evaluate performance implications of richer analytics and ensure lazy loading where possible.
