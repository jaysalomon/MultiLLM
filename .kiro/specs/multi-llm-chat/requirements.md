# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to conduct conversations with multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) simultaneously within a single chat interface. The system will support various LLM providers including API-based services, local models through Ollama, LM Studio, and other model hosting solutions. Each participating LLM will be aware of the multi-agent conversation context and can acknowledge and respond to inputs from other models as well as the user.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add multiple LLM models to a single chat conversation, so that I can compare responses and leverage different model strengths simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the multi-LLM chat interface THEN the system SHALL display options to add LLM models from different providers
2. WHEN the user selects an LLM provider THEN the system SHALL present configuration options specific to that provider (API keys, endpoints, model selection)
3. WHEN the user adds a model THEN the system SHALL validate the connection and display the model as active in the conversation
4. WHEN multiple models are active THEN the system SHALL display each model with a distinct visual identifier (name, color, avatar)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages that all active LLMs can see and respond to, so that I can get multiple perspectives on the same question.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL deliver the message to all active LLM models simultaneously
2. WHEN an LLM responds THEN the system SHALL display the response with clear attribution to the specific model
3. WHEN multiple responses are received THEN the system SHALL display them in the order they are received
4. WHEN an LLM fails to respond THEN the system SHALL display an error indicator for that specific model without blocking other responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a participating LLM, I want to be informed that I'm in a multi-agent conversation, so that I can acknowledge other participants and provide contextually appropriate responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is sent to an LLM THEN the system SHALL include context in the prompt indicating this is a multi-agent conversation
2. WHEN other LLMs have already responded THEN the system SHALL include their responses in the context for subsequent LLM calls
3. WHEN an LLM generates a response THEN the prompt SHALL include the names/identifiers of other active models in the conversation
4. WHEN the conversation history is sent THEN the system SHALL clearly attribute each message to its source (user or specific LLM)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure different LLM providers (APIs, Ollama, LM Studio), so that I can use my preferred models regardless of how they're hosted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects API-based providers THEN the system SHALL support configuration of API endpoints, authentication keys, and model selection
2. WHEN the user selects Ollama THEN the system SHALL support local Ollama instance connection and model selection
3. WHEN the user selects LM Studio THEN the system SHALL support LM Studio API connection and available model detection
4. WHEN provider configurations are saved THEN the system SHALL persist settings for future sessions
5. WHEN a provider connection fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage the conversation flow and model participation, so that I can control which models respond to specific messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user wants to address a specific model THEN the system SHALL provide a way to send messages to selected models only
2. WHEN the user wants to pause a model THEN the system SHALL allow temporarily disabling specific models without removing them
3. WHEN the user wants to remove a model THEN the system SHALL allow removing models from the active conversation
4. WHEN models are added or removed THEN the system SHALL update the conversation context for remaining models

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the conversation history with clear attribution, so that I can follow the multi-agent discussion effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing conversation history THEN the system SHALL display each message with clear visual attribution to its source
2. WHEN messages are from different models THEN the system SHALL use consistent visual identifiers throughout the conversation
3. WHEN the conversation is long THEN the system SHALL provide scrolling and navigation capabilities
4. WHEN the user wants to reference previous messages THEN the system SHALL support message threading or reply functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an LLM participant, I want to be able to directly respond to or question other LLMs in the conversation, so that we can have collaborative discussions and build on each other's responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an LLM wants to address another specific LLM THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism for direct LLM-to-LLM communication
2. WHEN an LLM responds to another LLM THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the conversational thread between models
3. WHEN LLMs engage in back-and-forth discussion THEN the system SHALL maintain the conversation flow and context for all participants
4. WHEN the user observes LLM-to-LLM interaction THEN the system SHALL display these exchanges clearly within the main conversation thread

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an LLM participant, I want access to persistent shared memory across all models in the conversation, so that we can maintain context, remember previous discussions, and build cumulative knowledge together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any LLM learns new information during the conversation THEN the system SHALL store this information in shared persistent memory accessible to all models
2. WHEN an LLM accesses shared memory THEN the system SHALL provide relevant context from previous conversations and accumulated knowledge
3. WHEN the conversation spans multiple sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain persistent memory across session boundaries
4. WHEN shared memory is updated THEN the system SHALL notify all active LLMs of relevant new information
5. WHEN memory becomes large THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent summarization and relevance filtering

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export or save multi-LLM conversations, so that I can reference the collaborative responses later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests to save a conversation THEN the system SHALL export the full conversation with proper attribution including LLM-to-LLM exchanges
2. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (JSON, markdown, plain text)
3. WHEN saving locally THEN the system SHALL preserve the conversation structure, model identifiers, and shared memory state
4. WHEN loading a saved conversation THEN the system SHALL restore the visual layout, attribution, and shared memory context

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want to inject contextual information from various sources into conversations, so that LLMs can provide more informed and relevant responses based on specific documentation, code, or data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects context sources THEN the system SHALL support injecting content from files, documentation, code repositories, web pages, and previous conversations
2. WHEN context is large THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent context compression and relevance scoring to stay within token limits
3. WHEN multiple context sources are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize and rank context by relevance to the current conversation topic
4. WHEN context is injected THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate to all LLMs what contextual information is available and its source
5. WHEN context becomes outdated THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to refresh, update, or remove context sources
6. WHEN token budget is constrained THEN the system SHALL dynamically allocate tokens between conversation history and injected context based on relevance

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want to analyze and track the performance of different LLMs, so that I can understand which models work best for different types of tasks and optimize my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLMs respond to messages THEN the system SHALL track response time, token count, and quality metrics for each model
2. WHEN conversations are completed THEN the system SHALL allow users to rate response quality and usefulness by model
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL display metrics including accuracy trends, speed comparisons, token efficiency, and cost analysis across different models
4. WHEN multiple models handle similar tasks THEN the system SHALL identify patterns and recommend optimal model combinations for specific use cases
5. WHEN performance data is available THEN the system SHALL provide insights such as which models excel at coding vs writing vs analysis tasks
6. WHEN new models are added THEN the system SHALL establish baseline performance metrics and track improvement or degradation over time
7. WHEN cost tracking is enabled THEN the system SHALL monitor API usage costs and provide budget alerts and optimization suggestions
