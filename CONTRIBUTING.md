# Contributing to Multi-LLM Chat

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Multi-LLM Chat! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## Where do I start?

If you're new to the project, a good place to start is by looking at the open issues, especially those labeled `good first issue`.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/multi-llm-chat/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-username/multi-llm-chat/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue and describe the enhancement you have in mind.
- Be clear about the **problem** you're trying to solve and the **solution** you're proposing.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).
5. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint` - you might need to add this script to `package.json`).
6. Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### TypeScript Styleguide

- Follow the existing code style.
- Use Prettier and ESLint to format your code.
